# Animation Tools and GUI Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing two distinct projects aimed at enhancing the workflow of animators through custom tools and intuitive GUIs. 

## Projects Overview

### 1. Animator Tools GUI
This project focuses on creating tools to simplify and automate repetitive tasks for animators. The tools are designed to integrate seamlessly into an artist's workflow, improving efficiency and productivity. 

#### Features
- **Automated Tasks**: Match Translate tool to automate common repetitive tasks of loading the rig into the scene and having to move it to the desired spot in the environment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using PyQt in QT Designer for a clean and intuitive user experience.
- **Customization**: Easily customizable to fit specific needs.



### 2. Proxy Rig Loader GUI
This project demonstrates my proficiency in creating GUIs with PyQt, providing a tool for loading proxy rigs for animation blocking. 
The proxy rigs included in this project were created by me to facilitate quick and easy animation setup.

#### Features
- **Proxy Rig Loading**: Load various proxy rigs for animation blocking.
- **Custom Proxy Rigs**: All proxy rigs were custom-made to streamline the blocking process.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface designed with PyQt.



3. Attribute Randomizer
This tool allows animators to quickly randomize key attributes such as translation, rotation, and scale, helping to add noise, camera shake etc with ease.

Features
-Randomization: Custom sliders for translate, rotate, and scale attributes.
-Range Control: Adjustable randomization ranges for each attribute.
-User-Friendly Interface: Built with maya based UI for ease of use.



4. Tween Machine
The tween machine tool helps animators make inbetweens between selected keyframes, optimizing the animation process.

Features
-Slider Control: Adjust the interpolation percentage using a UI slider.
-Keyframe Interpolation: Automatically calculate values between keyframes.
-Non-Destructive: Create new keyframes without altering existing ones.



5. Pose Transfer
The Pose Transfer tool enables animators to transfer animation data between two rigs, making it easier to reuse animations across different characters or rigs.

Features
-Controller Mapping: Easily transfer keyframes between different rigs with no namespace errors.
-Complete Transfer: Full transfer of keyframes across a timeline.
-Error Handling: Warns users if rigs don't match or data is incomplete.
